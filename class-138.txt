Types of Recommendation Systems:--

Demographic Filtering: This provides the same recommendation to all the audience based on popularity, rating or genre of the item.
We can see this type of recommendations in sections such as 'Trending Now', 'Popular on Netflix', etc. 
This is one of the most simple form of filtering. 
This assumes that items which are more popular or critically acclaimed will have higher chances of being liked by the general audience.

Content Based Filtering: This suggests similar items based on a particular item. 
This uses the item's similarity with the previously liked or saved items of the user based on item's metadata or current search keywords used by user to find some item. 
This assumes that a user has higher chances to like similar items based on previous history of the user. 
Also, this helps in giving relevant recommendations to the user based on searched keywords.

Collaborating Filtering: This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. 
Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like in content-based filtering. 
This kind of recommendations implementation can be seen in Amazon or Flipkart under 'Frequently Bought Together' section.
